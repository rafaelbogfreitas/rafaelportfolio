        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rafael. Hopefully I will give you an idea of myself in the next few lines. If there is one think
        I can say about me, is that everytime I got interested in something I became an enthusiast. I like challenges
        and can spend hours, days or perhaps months trying to get a puzzle solved. I also love cycling, specially
        travelling on the bicycle. I have taken on the London to Paris route once and didn't enjoy the destination as much
        as I enjoyed the way to get there.</p>
        <p>I currently work as floor manager in a busy London restaurant, where I have learned valuable life skills and work
        ethics. I am able to meet up with deadlines, to listen and accept critics, to adapt positively to changes and to work
        in a team.</p>
        <p>Eight months ago I got introduced to web development and after trying out some HTML5 and seeing it displayed on
        the screen, I got addicted and couldn't stop learning as every new discovery led me to another one and so on. I then
        came up to the resolution that even though I really enjoy what I do now, I am passionate about web development and
        therefore want to do this for life.</p>
        <p>Here you can see what I have achieved in my short journey in web development. Hope you enjoy!</p>

            <p>This is my first project ever, when I decided to take on the Free Code Camp's
            responsive web development curriculum. The idea was to create a tribute page, with an image that would resize
            according to the screen and comprehensive HTML for accesibility. I have used pseudo-selectors for creating pulling
            quotes and also media queries for a better layout on smaller screens.

              form elements and a banner. I took the oportunity to expand my CSS3 knowledge, learning how to
              reasonably make use of transforms with transitions for better user experience. I have practice
              more flexbox and learned more how to use form elements with client-side validation.

            <h2>Arturas Grimalis Photography Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>In my first months of learning from scratch how to code, a friend present me with this challenge:
              he asked me if I could create a Photography portfolio website and he wanted it showcasesing his
              pictures with a destructured layout, like pictures scattered on a white background. By this time I was
              probably not ready to get everything he asked me done, but I said 'yes' and tried it anyway. I thought it
              would be a good idea to use CSS grid and started learning how to use it. It looked great on safari and chrome,
              but when I went to show it to him on IE, surprise! I then worked on fixing it...

            <section class="more">
              <p>I took me a while to get the hang of it, but somehow I managed to get it working on IE. I made also a second grid,
              for smaller screens, which 'organizes' the pictures if you resize the browser. He was happy and went further asking me
              to create some functionality to the page. He wanted an overlay with a bigger version of the pictures whenever they were
              clicked and a pair of arrows to move through all of them. I didn't know any JavaScript at that time, but took on the challenge
              again and started diving in it. I managed to put it all together and he was very happy with the result. I used JavaScript
              to style DOM elements so I could get some practice. The page is live <a href="https://rafaelbogfreitas.github.io">here</a> but he keeps
              telling me he will buy a domain but never does it!</p>

            <h2>Rafael Freitas Web Development - Portfolio</h2>
            <p>This is the last project for Free Code Camp's responsive web development curriculum. The purpose of this project
              was to build a portfolio page to display the previous projects on the same curriculum and the future ones. It was meant
              to be a simple build with only HTML5 and CSS3 but I decided to take a step further and make it as good as I can and
              possibly use it as my actual portifolio for hopefully getting my first Front End Dev job.</p>
              <p>While working on this project I was already familiar to a certain extend with NPM, I then used Gulp to uglify my JS files
              and cssnano to minify my style sheets. I have used SASS to write the styles and Gulp-Sass to compile them...

            <!-- Show More -->
            <section class="more">
              <p>I also was familiar with JQuery and used this project to expand my knowledge and give my portfolio interactivity.
              Once again I have expanded my skills with Flexbox and was happy and comfortable controlling the layout as I wanted. The website
              is responsive and looks good in every screen size.</p>
