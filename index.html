Hopefully I will give you an idea of myself in the next few lines. If there is one thing I can say about me, is that everytime I got interested in something I became an enthusiast. I like challenges and can spend hours, days or perhaps months trying to get a puzzle solved. I also love cycling, specially travelling on the bicycle. I have taken on the London to Paris route once and didn't enjoy the destination as much as I enjoyed the way to get there.</p><p>I currently work as floor manager in a busy London restaurant, where I have learned valuable life skills and work ethics. I am able to meet up with deadlines, to listen and accept critics, to adapt positively to changes and to work in a team.</p><p>Eight months ago I got introduced to web development and after trying out some HTML5 and seeing it displayed on the screen, I got addicted and couldn't stop learning as every new discovery led me to another one and so on. I then came up to the resolution that even though I really enjoy what I do now, I am passionate about web development and therefore want to do this for life.</p><p>Here you can see what I have achieved in my short journey in web development. Hope you enjoy!</p></div><aside class=skills><div class=skills-box><div class=skills-section><h2 class=skills-title><div class=text>My Skills</div></h2><section class="skills-content hidden"><ul><li><span>HTML5</span> - Able to write concise, comprehensive and accessible.</li><li><span>CSS3</span> - Broad knowledge of the selectors, tools like flexbox and grid, animations and box-model.

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio page to display the previous projects on the same curriculum and the future ones. It was meant to be a simple build with only HTML5 and CSS3 but I decided to take a step further and make it as good as I can and possibly use it as my actual portifolio for hopefully getting my first Front End Dev job.</p><p>While working on this project I was already familiar to a certain extend with NPM, I then used Gulp to uglify my JS files and cssnano to minify my style sheets. I have used SASS to write the styles and Gulp-Sass to compile them...<nobr><span class=show-more>Show More +</span></nobr></p><section class=more><p>I also was familiar with JQuery and used this project to expand my knowledge and give my portfolio interactivity.

By this time I was probably not ready to get everything he asked me done, but I said 'yes' and tried it anyway. I thought it would be a good idea to use CSS grid and started learning how to use it. It looked great on safari and chrome, but when I went to show it to him on IE, surprise! I then worked on fixing it...<nobr><span class=show-more>Show More +</span></nobr></p><section class=more><p>I took me a while to get the hang of it, but somehow I managed to get it working on IE. I made also a second grid, for smaller screens, which 'organizes' the pictures if you resize the browser. He was happy and went further asking me to create some functionality to the page. He wanted an overlay with a bigger version of the pictures whenever they were clicked and a pair of arrows to move through all of them. I didn't know any JavaScript at that time, but took on the challenge again and started diving in it. I managed to put it all together and he was very happy with the result. I used JavaScript to style DOM elements so I could get some practice. The page is live <a href=https://rafaelbogfreitas.github.io>here</a> but he keeps telling me he will buy a domain but never does it!</p><h3>Technologies used</h3><ul><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 (Grid)</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Checkout the repository<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/rafaelbogfreitas/rafaelbogfreitas.github.io><i class="fab fa-github-square"></i></a></li></ul></section></div></div><div class=project-container><a href=https://codepen.io/rafaelbogfreitas/full/BEQBvO target=_blank><img src=images/technicaldoc.png alt="form website project"></a><div class=project-description><h2>Free Code Camp: Technical Documentation Page</h2><p>In this project I created a documentation page as requested by Free Code Camp in their fourth project for responsive web designer curriculum. I have written comprehensive and accessible HTML5, used flex box for the page layout and even though not recommended for FCC, created functionality with JavaScript + Flexbox properties to change the navigation bar position on the screen or completly remove it for better reading. For smaller screens I have used media queries and 'rem' size units to make the website responsive. I have used trasitions with different delay times to make the moving of the navigation bar and the buttons smooth. I was really excited with this project as I had more knowledge and was feeling comfortable and confident on creating the features the way I wanted.<nobr><span class=show-more>Show More +</span></nobr></p><section class=more><h3>Technologies used</h3><ul><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 (Flexbox, Transforms, Transitions)</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Git & GitHub</li><li>Checkout the repository<a href=https://github.com/rafaelbogfreitas/technicalDocumentation><i class="fab fa-github-square"></i></a></li></ul></section></div></div><div class=project-container><a href=https://codepen.io/rafaelbogfreitas/full/YdgYed target=_blank><img src=images/productLanding.png alt="form website project"></a><div class=project-description><h2>Free Code Camp: Product Landing</h2><p>This is the third project I created for Free Code Camp's curriculum on responsive web design.
