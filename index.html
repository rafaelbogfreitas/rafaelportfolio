I am enthusiastic about CSS preprocessors and modern technologies as flex-box, grid and animations. As I have a passionate interest in JavaScript and ES6, I spend most of my energy researching it and before even considering to learn JS libraries or frameworks I was practicing and studying vanilla first. Most recently my time is spent on learning React.</p><p>Nowadays, I have been focusing on getting better at organizing my code and making it as simple and semantic as possible, as my goal is to be part of a team and share my work with others.</p><p>Now I work as a floor manager in a busy London restaurant, where I have learned valuable life skills and work ethics. I can meet up with deadlines, listen and accept critics, adapt positively to changes and work with a team.</p><p>I have always been curious by nature and like challenges and puzzles. I am into cycling and have taken on the London to Paris route once but didn't enjoy the destination as much as I enjoyed the ride to get there.</p><p>Here you can see what I have achieved in my short journey in web development. I hope you enjoy!</p></div><aside class=skills><div class=skills-box><div class=skills-section><h2 class=skills-title><div class=text>My Skills</div></h2><section class="skills-content hidden"><ul><li><span>HTML5</span> - Able to write concise, comprehensive and accessible.</li><li><span>CSS3</span> - Broad knowledge of the selectors, tools like flexbox and grid, animations and box-model.

He asked me for a website where he could show his music and videos and have a short 'about me' to introduce himself and work. He had no idea of how he wanted it to look like, so I also designed the page.</p><p>In this project, I was more advanced with SASS, JavaScript and JQuery, so I had liberty for getting more creative. Mixins were used to automate the inclusion of vendor prefixes for flex-box.

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio page to display the previous projects on the same curriculum and the future ones. It was meant to be a simple build with only HTML5 and CSS3 but I decided to take a step further and make it as good as I can and possibly use it as my actual portfolio for hopefully getting my first Front End Dev job.</p><p>While working on this project I was already familiar to a certain extent with NPM, I then used Gulp to uglify my JS files and cssnano to minify my style sheets.

By this time I was probably not ready to get everything he asked me done, but I said 'yes' and tried it anyway. I thought it would be a good idea to use CSS grid and started learning how to use it. It looked great on safari and chrome, but when I went to show it to him on IE, surprise! I then worked on fixing it...<nobr><span class=show-more>Show More +</span></nobr></p><section class=more><p>I took me a while to get the hang of it, but somehow I managed to get it working on IE. I made also a second grid, for smaller screens, which 'organizes' the pictures if you resize the browser. He was happy and went further asking me to create some functionality to the page. He wanted an overlay with a bigger version of the pictures whenever they were clicked and a pair of arrows to move through all of them. I didn't know any JavaScript at that time, but took on the challenge again and started diving in it. I managed to put it all together and he was very happy with the result. I used JavaScript to style DOM elements so I could get some practice. The page is live <a href=https://rafaelbogfreitas.github.io>here</a> but he keeps telling me he will buy a domain but never does it!</p><aside><h3>Technologies used:</h3><ul><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 (Grid)</li><li>JavaScript</li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/rafaelbogfreitas/rafaelbogfreitas.github.io><i class="fab fa-github-square"></i></a></li></ul></aside></section></div></div><div class=project-container><a href=https://codepen.io/rafaelbogfreitas/full/BEQBvO target=_blank><img src=images/technicaldoc.png alt="form website project"></a><div class=project-description><h2>Free Code Camp: Technical Documentation Page</h2><p>In this project, I created a documentation page as requested by Free Code Camp in their fourth project for responsive web designer curriculum. I have written comprehensive and accessible HTML5, used flex box for the page layout and even though not recommended for FCC, created functionality with JavaScript + Flexbox properties to change the navigation bar position on the screen or completely remove it for better reading. For smaller screens I have used media queries and 'rem' size units to make the website responsive. I have used transitions with different delay times to make the moving of the navigation bar and the buttons smooth.
